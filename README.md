## Take-Home Data Challenge

### Description

N1 Health’s client, a national Medicare Advantage plan, is seeking to understand how best to use its resources to address food access challenges in its membership. N1 Health has been tasked with presenting a short analysis (approximately 5–10 minutes) of publicly available data to the Chief Medical Officer to answer this question.

The guiding questions are:

- Where should we deploy a food access program?
- How many people will be included? How many might be successfully engaged?
- Which subgroup of the population might benefit the most from the program?
- What is the projected impact of this program?

You may use general research and simplifying assumptions to answer any of the questions.

### Data

Please use these two datasets as the primary source for analysis. The core data within these files will also be included in a SQLite database named `challenge.db`.

- **CDC – 500 Cities Project**  
  https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-Census-Tract-level-Data-GIS-Friendly-Fo/k86t-wghb

- **USDA – Food Environment Atlas**  
  https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/

Note that FIPS codes may be useful for combining this data. Use this reference to understand their structure within the above files:

### What We’re Evaluating For

- Can you produce a compelling analytical story from novel, messy datasets?
- Can you communicate these results to a non-technical audience?

---

### Submission Guidelines
:

- **Preferred:** Jupyter Notebook with code and visualizations
- Other script or code (e.g., RMarkdown file, SQL script)
- Excel file with all work shown

Please create **2–3 key data visualizations** to answer the guiding questions above. Additional visualizations are acceptable but should be treated as appendix material rather than part of the core deliverable.

---

### Presentation

You will be given a chance to present the analysis and will be asked questions about both the results and the code.

Please create a short presentation with approximately **5 slides** to show your results.

---

### Time Expectation

This project is expected to take around **4 hours** of your time over the course of one week.

We are evaluating your **instincts and thought process**, not the amount of time spent. If needed, we strongly recommend stopping work early and describing your analytical plan during the presentation.

### Questions

If any questions come up, please feel free to email the hiring manager throughout the process.
